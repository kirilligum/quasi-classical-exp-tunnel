\section{exp-to-exp tunneling}

\subsection{Idea}
The idea is to model a tunneling from increasing exponential to the decreasing one with a gaussian coupling. 

\begin{equation}
  H = \frac{p^2}{2m} + e^r n1 + e^{-r} n2  + e^{-r^2} n1 n2
\end{equation}

plot here
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{gnuplot}
    plot [-2:2] exp(x) lw 2 , exp(-x) lw 2, 2*exp(-x*x) lw 2 
  \end{gnuplot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Problem}

The standard binning procedure that we used before doesn't work.

Suppose the initial condition is a gaussian distribution around $p=10$, $q=-10$.
If $n1=1$ and $n2=0$, everything works. However, when we start using binning, $n2\neq 0$.
This means that the term $e^{-r}n2$ can be very large and dominate the hamiltonian. 
The same problem appears after the transition through the barrier since $n1\neq0$.

\subsection{Proposed solutions}

There are 3 ways to solve the problem by changing:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the potential -- similar to Tully
  \item the sampling
  \item varience in $n$ 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Changing the potential}
\subsection{Proportional sampling}
we need to change the sampling so that in the begining and in the end the energy doesn't go infinite.
to do that, we change the sizes of the sampling bins relative to the size of the potential. we also throw away trajectories after the tunneling
when the traj goes outside of the bin+bin\_varience, it gets thrown out
\subsection{Dynamic variance}
v1*n1 becomes something like v1*(n1i + (n1-n1i)/v1) or v1*(n1i + (n1-n1i)*exp(v1-v2)) or v1/v2.
the idea is to make the bin for n1 smaller when one of the potentials is much larger then the other.

\subsection{when the increasing potential comes too high, kill the bins}

didn't work that well. it switches too late
\subsection{proportional binning in the begining}
Sat Aug 31 14:57:57 PDT 2013
\begin{itemize}
  \item \done put v1 and v2 potentials into methods
  \item \done calculate the energy of the surfaces from the initial state before binning.
  \item \done change the bins proportional to the energies
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
when both momentum and poition is positive, and n1 fully transfered to n2, the particle should keep moving. 
that is when i should make n1 = 0.
\subsection{mark thrown out trajectory as bad}
Fri Aug 30 19:29:01 PDT 2013
in the state vector, after energy 0 is for a good traj, 1 is for bad. it's a bit of a waste to have it as a double but it's ok.

\subsection{make a function to throw out trajs that get way out of range}
\begin{itemize}
  \item give initial energy as a parameter.
  \item when the deviation of the energy becomes 2x large, throw the trajectory out
\end{itemize}
